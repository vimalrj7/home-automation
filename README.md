# home-automation
This repository contains all the different scripts I use to automate stuff around my house. Most of them involve a RaspberryPi3 and an Arduino.

Lamp Control - A simple script that uses a relay to control the lamp in my room. I use Google Assistant along with Tasker and AutoVoice to give ssh commands to the the Pi to run the script.

LDR - A script that makes sure I don't leave the lights on for too long. It utilises a LDR to detect if light in the room is on, and sends me a notification on my phone. 

Movie Scraper - a script that uses Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the local cinema website, and sends my mom and email with all the hindi movies playing that week.
